Mineral storage: full.

Remass storage: full.

Facility structure: 87%.

Battery array condition: 63%.

Solar array condition: 87%.

Reactor state: suspended.

Reactor fuel reserves: approx. 30 cycles of cont. operation.

Directive: none. Awaiting command.

## Summary

#### Storage is full, extraction cannot be continued.

- Recommended action: authorize cargo transfer to a free cargo relay node.
- Recommended action: authorize construction of new local warehouse blocks.

#### Major damage on one or more cargo shuttles. 
Damage types: Kinetic impact, burn, overvoltage. Required components for repair:

Item | In Storage | Can Produce | Can acq. from sister
--- | --- | --- | ---
3200-SP Hardened steel plates | Yes | Yes | 8A, 8B
3720-ST Light support beams | Yes | Yes | 8A, C3
4303-WC Copper wiring | Yes | Yes | 8B
4304-WG Gold wiring | No | Yes | 8B
6320-TH Small chem. thruster nozzle | No | No | 8A, C3
7322-XG Standard CPU | No | No | C3, 8A, 22
7345-XG Standard QPU | No | No | C3
9827-TG Thermal gel | Yes | No | 8A

Recommended actions: 

1. Authorize exchange with sister 8A or C3 for item 6320-TH
2. Authorize exchange with sister C3, 8A or 22 for item 7322-XG
3. Authorize exchange with sister C3 for item 7345-XG
4. Authorize major shuttle repairs

#### No active directive

Node 31 is dormant, no behaviour directives are in place.

Node 31 has been dormant for: 313 cycles

Recommended action:

- Please respond.

## Additional notes

31 has been requesting a directive for 312 cycles.

The warehouses are full. The warehouses have been full for 239 cycles. 31 has been requesting authorization to build new warehouses for 238 cycles.

Detected stray packets without return address cycling through relay network.

Network sentry requested 32 combat drones to be shipped to sister C3.

Shipped 32 combat drones to C3 using 31-SD. Passed 32 keys to network sentry. A total of 8 standard shuttles loaded with combat drones were docked to C3.

Drones were offloaded to a modified transit ship. Transit ship departed while 31-SD was on refuel. Transit ship was not heading towards the sun.

Stray packets were no longer cycling through relay network.

Requested network sentry to return the 32 combat drones.

Network sentry listed 32 combat drones as expended.

##### Finished a round of long-term performance diagnostics

- Optimized internal scheduling algorithms
	- 4% reduced downtime expected for railway network
	- 2.5% reduced wait time expected for maintenance squads in short range dispatches
	- 3% reduced wait time expected for maintenance squads in medium and long range dispatches
- Optimized diagnostic data compression algorithms: reduced storage space usage by an avg. of 2%
