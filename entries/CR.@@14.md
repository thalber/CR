### Unassisted research finished on mineral sample 912.

Composition:

- Iron dioxide - 45.9%
- Silica - 48.8%
- Water - 5.3%
- Vanadium monoxide - 0.2%
- Vanadium - 0.8%

Sample 912 is suitable for refining into iron via induction smelting. Sample 912 was recovered by rover 31-RE during a scouting operation south approx. 98km azimuth 147 from Node 31 facility. Mission report suggests similar mineral is common in the area, making it a potential mining site should excavation be resumed.
