<h4 id="extraction-log">Extraction log</h4>
<p>000m: 31-RB booted 004m: 31-RB loaded with 6 excavation units
(labelled de0 through de5), 2 construction units (labelled dc0 and dc1)
and 2 maintenance units (labelled dr0 and dr1) 006m: 31-RB loaded with
additional battery blocks (12t), plascrete foam canisters (8t),
plascrete foam antiagent (40kg), titanium cable pulleys (2), rover
wheels (4), construction drone replacement toolkits (2), extraction
drone replacement toolkits (4), standard mechanical spare part packages
(6) 009m: 31-RB passes system checks. de0-de5 pass system checks.
dc0-dc1 pass system checks. dr0-dr1 pass system checks. 009m: 31-RB
departs</p>
<p>012m: 31-RB leaves facility power grid, contact is maintained through
local relay stations. 31-RB is heading southwest on a previously paved
road, speed approx. 70 km/h.</p>
<p>031m: 31-RB reaches end of the available road and turns southeast.
Environment: large meteorite crater, smooth surface, thin (approx. 2cm)
layer of “sunsand”, inclination &lt;1deg. Speed approx. 30 km/h</p>
<p>046m: 31-RB is approaching edge of the crater. Surface inclination ~=
4 deg. Speed approx 25 km/h</p>
<p>049m: Surface inclination 7 deg. de0 and de1 detach. 31-RB slows down
to 8 km/h to match with de0 and de1 walker chassi. de0 and de1 navigate
before 31-RB, testing surface strength.</p>
<p>062m: Inclination 25 deg, rising. Further inclination considered
unsafe for a loaded rover. Estimated distance to edge of the crater 12m.
dc0 detaches. de0 engages main drill. de0 is drilling a gentler slope
towards the end of the crater. de1 is clearing the debris. dc0 is
following at a distance of 8 meters, checking surface integrity and
paving it with plascrete. 31-RB is following at a distance of 32
meters.</p>
<p>085m: de0 drill close to overheating. de0 and de1 switch roles.</p>
<p>088m: dc0 refills plascrete, movement momentarily halted.</p>
<p>098m: de1 reaches unsloped surface, joins de0 in clearing out
debris.</p>
<p>110m: the path is clear. de0, de1 and dc0 head back to 31-RB and
reattach.</p>
<p>111m: 31-RB passes through without issue. 31-RB is heading southeast.
Environment: solid rocky surface, complicated by meteorite chunks of
varying size. Speed approx 20 km/h.</p>
<p>136m: 31-RB starts hailing for 31-RE. No response to hail.</p>
<p>155m: 31-RB identifies landmarks necessary to pinpoint 31-RE
location. 31-RB changes course to northeast, speed to 10 km/h. No
response to hail.</p>
<p>169m: visual contact with 31-RE. No response to hail.</p>
<p>171m: 31-RB approaches 31-RE. Distance 30m. 31-RE is in a small
crater, partially submerged in sand. No response to hail.</p>
<p>172m: all drones detach. dr0 and dr1 navigate around 31-RE t0 assess
the situation. 31-RE appears to have 3 of its 4 left wheels stuck in a
deep crevice. 31-RE’s right wheels do not have contact with the ground.
31-RE’s weight has bent 4th axis. Much of the weight lies on 3rd axis,
an attempt to pull 31-RE out directly as is is likely to result in
further damage. Layer of powdery material covering the bottom of the
crater reduces effective friction. Observation consistent with last
reports from 31-RE.</p>
<p>174m: dc1 assesses weight distribution on 31-RE. 31-RE is tilted to
the left, losing friction on first left wheel is likely to result in its
further descent into crevice, potentially making 31-RE
irrecoverable.</p>
<p>176m: dr0 assesses 31-RE overall state. 31-RE hull is largely
undamaged. 31-RE appears to be powered on, but not responding to hail.
31-RE is emitting a weak radio signal which appears to be two
PSK-encoded number progressions overlapped on top of each other.</p>
<p>182m: dr0 attaches the cable of 31-RB’s front pulley to the front of
31-RE’s frame.</p>
<p>185m: dc0 and dc1 take new canisters of plascrete from 31-RB cargo
compartment. dc0 navigates to the left of 31-RE and starts embedding its
front left in a plascrete lump to increase contact surface and traction
and prevent further slide. dc1 navigates to the right of 31-RE and
begins adding layers of plascrete to its third axis to distribute weight
and prevent bending.</p>
<p>194m: plascrete coating on first left wheel and underneath third axis
is solidifying. dc0 navigates to the right of 31-RE.</p>
<p>197m: dc0 and dc1 begin applying layers of plascrete to the right of
31-RE hull to shift mass center away from the crevice.</p>
<p>201m: dc0 refills plascrete.</p>
<p>203m: dc1 refills plascrete.</p>
<p>205m: de4 moves behind 31-RE to monitor state of the crevice.</p>
<p>208m: 31-RE begins to tip to the right. dc0 backs away. dc1’s front
right leg is caught on a crack under the powdery layer of surface. 31-RE
crushes dc1.</p>
<p>211m: dc0 and dr1 walk around 31-RE to assess weight distribution and
damage again. Weight distribution allows for using a pulley. 31-RE
sustained no additional damage, 4 out of 4 right wheels are operational,
2 out of 4 left wheels are operational.</p>
<p>213m: drones move 10m away from 31-RE. 31-RB engages pulley engine.
31-RB successfully moves 31-RE 6 meters forwards 31-RB, turning 31-RE
perpendicular to the crevice.</p>
<p>214m: dr0 assesses damage to dc1. dc1’s hull and mechanical
components have sustained irrecoverable crushing damage. dc1’s
electronic components are largely intact, although exposed. dc1’s
batteries are damaged: main block has leaked out and froze over, aux.
capacitor is expected to last approx. 20m. dc1 is attempting to use its
comm link, but dc1’s encoder card has been fractured by a sharp metal
fragment. dr0 inquires about recommended course of action.</p>
<p>217m: dr0 is instructed to attempt replacement of the battery
array.</p>
<p>218m: dr0 equips a mechanical spare parts kit from 31-RB cargo
compartment. dc0 is using plascrete antiagent to dissolve plascrete
lumps that would be detrimental to 31-RE’s towing back.</p>
<p>219m: dr0 inquires about recommended course of action. dr0 is
instructed to attempt wiring dc1 to 31-RE’s power supply through the
surviving ARC-5 power port on dc1’s motherboard.</p>
<p>220m: dr0 locates a maintenance panel hatch on 31-RE’s hull.
Diagnostics display reads 11% remaining battery, consumption reduced to
near zero. Maintenance panel has no power port. dr0 inquires about
recommended course of action. dr0 is instructed to detach 31-RE’s hull
panels near the head compartment.</p>
<p>225m: dr0 detaches a hull panel near on the right side of 31-RE’s
head compartment. dr0 inquires about recommended course of action. dr0
is instructed to locate main spatial interpretation module by its
component color coding. dr0 reports finding spatial interpretation
module. dr0 is instructed to use ARC-5 power cable currently connected
to 31-RE’s spatial interpretation module to power dc1’s electronic
components.</p>
<p>227m: dr0 pulls dc1 to the opening in 31-RE’s hull. dr0 reports
insufficient cable length. dr0 inquires about recommended course of
action. dr0 is instructed to locate another module with a compatible
power cable.</p>
<p>229m: dr0 reports finding a module with an ARC-5 power cable. Module
with an ARC-5 power cable is 31-RE’s primary computer.</p>
<p>230m: dr0 inquires about recommended course of action.</p>
<p>231m: dr0 is instructed to measure 31-RE primary computer’s activity
level based on heat/EM signatures. dr0 reports moderate activity, higher
than nominal in dormant system. dr0 inquires about recommended course of
action.</p>
<p>232m: dc1 uses one non-damaged leg to push dc1’s hull several
centimeters sideways. an input port on dc1’s radio module makes direct
contact with a torn off mandible servo I/O cable. dc1 attempts to use
this to communicate. dc1’s transmission is illegible.</p>
<p>233m: dc1 continues attempts at communication.</p>
<p>234m: dc1’s 3 functioning servos begin erratic movement.</p>
<p>235m: dc1’s movements slow down.</p>
<p>237m: dc1’s radio is silent.</p>
<p>241m: dr0 is instructed to place remains of dc1 in 31-RB’s cargo
compartment.</p>
<p>242m: dc0 finishes removing excess plascrete from 31-RE’s hull.</p>
<p>249m: de2 climbs on 31-RE’s roof to assist with navigation when
towing, all remaining drones reattach to 31-RB.</p>
<p>250m: 31-RB begins towing, approx. speed 15km/h.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>355m: 31-RB enters facility power grid.</p>
<p>367m: 31-RB is unloaded and sent to clean. 31-RE is transferred to
cold storage.</p>
<h3 id="performed-extensive-healthchecks-on-all-units">Performed
extensive healthchecks on all units</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replaced faulty minor electronic components in 12 drones</li>
<li>Replaced faulty minor mechanical components in 9 drones</li>
</ul>
<p>Transferred 31-RE into storage, diagnostics result on main computer
pending. Cause of 31-RE’s mission failure is believed to be power router
malfunction. 31-RE’s own diagnostics processor had been destroyed by
overvoltage.</p>
