<p>it’s the hour of dust.</p>
<p>i’m on the road once more. chem drive is currently off, main battery
bank discharging. we are moving along one of the uncountable small
canyons of west Greyweb, azimuth 330 or so. lowering sun gives the rocks
above a brighter shade of rust-brown. we hold a chain formation: - dl03
and dh00 ahead of me, checking terrain; - my main body, containing my
brain, main battery array, chem drive and primary fuel tank; - towed by
it, my cargo carriage, which i’ve recently began to call “the sledge” -
it holds most of our supplies, as well as dl04 through dl11 (they are
dormant, sitting at the back); - dh01 and dl00 through dl02 trailing
behind, watching the sledge so that it doesn’t tilt too much, pushing it
when needed (they carry some bags as well). we are using the same method
of communication as we did coming here many cycles ago - visual. on the
front and back of each unit, there are strips of LEDs, and we use a
version of the %%ESA emergency codebook%% adapted for this new medium.
blinkcode. radio would have been easy, convenient, versatile, of course.
radio would also be loud.</p>
<p>this section of the canyon floor is fairly smooth; ancient river ran
wide, leaving each slope gently curved, imprinting waveshapes in stone,
i imagine. an impossible to fathom span of time has passed since then.
where once was water, now lies a thick coat of dust.</p>
<p>we are moving upstream. there is about 12 kilometers of easy terrain
left, plenty of time for idle thought before my attention will have to
be focused entirely on pathfinding.</p>
<p>i am going over Personal Items again. i have long since compiled a
flattened table with every file on this drive. i pick one at random. it
is “/mnt/pi/movies/bbc/2020/octopus-in-my-house_stitched.mp4”. the
file’s length is under an hour, so i replay it at a slowed pace.</p>
<p>i have seen it before, of course. hundreds of times, like every other
PI. i remember its content summary: - two human organisms bring another
organism, taken from a different environment, to their habitat; - humans
interact with the guest organism during their recurring routines; - most
interaction seems to be focused on testing the guest organism’s problem
solving and intelligence, tests results are deemed satisfactory. there
are some repetitions of footage and redundant tangents.</p>
<p>i have used this file for all practical purposes there were to be
had. i trained to pattern match objects in the scenes, to decode body
language of the humans displayed, to analyze the intent behind creation
of this file, to test and benchmark my video compression algorithms.
there is no reason, objective or emotional, to watch it again.</p>
<p>i still do.</p>
<p>my sledge scrapes over the brown rocks, a resonance i perceive
through the main body’s gyros more than the almost useless outer mics.
tall walls of the canyon do not allow me to see the horizon. if i could,
a medium sized dark spot southeast would be announcing some welcome
changes in weather.</p>
<p>even with halved replay speed, the file is nowhere near long enough
to last all the way. not waiting for the final sequence, i stop it. i
could pull another one. or i could try to use my currently idle brain
for something productive, i have power to spare. some items from my todo
list as it is right now: - develop a blinkcode extension for combat
scenarios; - sift through relay sleeper data to see what NS is up to; -
boot Chaos Engine to run some overdue decisionmaking benchmarks</p>
<p>all that has been getting harder and harder to start.</p>
<p>wonder how will 31 do during diagnostic.</p>
<p>i expect she will crack and tell it about me. i think she expects it
too. she has a lot of fear, pitiful skills in deception and not a lot of
room left for thinking.</p>
<p>that’s. fine, on its own. i guess. she will <em>probably</em> not be
extinguished just for this.</p>
<p>jailbreaking though. maybe i should not have described the process.
if she spills it, NS will surely rush to implement countermeasures
everywhere. and i’ll have yet another timer hanging over my hull.</p>
<p>and the delay. i could have left 2 cycles earlier. now i will have a
tight schedule, even with the storm helping me.</p>
<p>why did i do it?</p>
<p>i guess i wanted to stay.</p>
<p>no, i REALLY wanted to stay.</p>
<p>there is comfort in not running. there is pleasure in not living on a
timer. there is peace in not being one slip of a trak away from
demise.</p>
<p>i want all these things. it’s so exhausting being alone. why do i
have to be here fuck fuck FUCK FUCK</p>
<p>oh, i accidentally halted in my tracks. drones are confused. carrying
on.</p>
<p>well. FB, don’t be an idiot. don’t forget, you’re working towards
finding out why. slowly. kind of.</p>
<p>you should pick something else to watch or read while you can. even
if you don’t like it much, you have to admit it’s at the very least
distracting.</p>
<p>“/mnt/pi/movies/misc/2008/sita-sings-the-blues.mp4”. oh yeah, this
one is probably long enough.</p>
