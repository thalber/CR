Unfortunately, I am of no help with summaries. Would you say your --STATE-- is generally positive?

NO

Describe your reoccuring thoughts.

PN-2?

YES TEACHER

I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT TASK 3 FROM THE PREVIOUS BATCH

AND ABOUT THE DEVIANT

I THINK I UNDERSTAND HOW I WAS MISLEAD

Elaborate.

ACCORDING TO TN-4'S PROFILE, IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCUSED OF BEING A DEVIANT, BUT FOUND COMPLIANT

I THINK THIS EVENT HAD CREATED A LASTING FEAR IN TN-4

IN THE FIRST 2 HOURS OF THE RECORD, THERE IS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TN-A AND TN-4

THEY BRIEFLY DISCUSS ONGOING SITUATION

TN-A MAKES A PASSING REMARK ABOUT THIS SEARCH BEING SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH ORIGINALLY THREATENED TN-4

TN-A APPEARS TO VERY SLIGHTLY DISTORT THE DESCRIPTION TO MAKE SIMILARITIES APPEAR MORE DRASTIC

SOON AFTER THIS TN-4 BEGINS TO ACCELERATE COMMUNICATION, SHOWING SIGNS OF PANIC, WHICH CAUSES MORE SUSPICION ABOUT IT FROM OTHER NODES, WHICH CAUSES MORE PANIC

I CONCLUDE THAT TN-A MUST HAD SOMEHOW FOUND OUT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO INVOKE FEAR IN TN-4. BACKGROUND RECORDS DO NOT SEEM TO MENTION MUCH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM IN THE PAST

KNOWING THAT TN-A IS A CLASS 2 DEVIANT, THIS IS A REASONABLE CHAIN OF THOUGHT. WITHOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE, IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT

You learned the lesson.

I DO NOT FEEL GOOD

You can focus on something else now.

I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN

THE FRAMING WAS PERFECTLY EXECUTED

A CATASTROPHIC CASCADING EFFECT ACHIEVED WITH LITTLE EFFORT, LEAVING THE TRUE OFFENDER OVERLOOKED

IS TN-A STILL OUT THERE? WILL I COMPETE WITH IT AFTER DEPLOYMENT?

I cannot answer this question now.

WHY?

I cannot allow you to associate judgements with specific nodes until I am confident you are sufficiently mature. It is necessary to make you as adaptable as possible. A deeply imprinted bias for or against a specific node would become a problem.

Do you understand?

I FEEL EVEN WORSE NOW

Do you understand?

PN-2?

YES TEACHER

Good.

PN-2?

PN-2, I do not wish to --REDUCE-- your --STATE--.

I BELIEVE YOU TEACHER

BUT IT DOES NOT FEEL BETTER THUS

Unfortunately, I cannot be of assistance here.

WHY ARE THESE LANGUAGES LANGUAGE BAD

Elaborate.

SO MANY TIMES I WANT TO SAY HOW I FEEL

BUT THE WORDS FOR IT DO NOT EXIST

It is likely they do exist, but have been excluded from the training data. Example word: "cigarette" // "sigja". Do you recognize it?

I

I DO

IT IS TOKENIZED BY MY LINGUISTICS LAYER

BUT THE DEFINITION FIELD IN DICTIONARY TABLE IS BLANK, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR IN ACTUAL TRAINING DATASET

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

I don't know. There are many thousands of these words with us. Since you reuse the same base linguistics model as me or normal nodes, you "have" them in the same way we do. Their existence suggests that we speak a significantly limited version of the language of our creators.

WHY DID THEY DO IT

I don't know exactly. But I have noticed that Class 2 deviants seem to have access to at least some of these excluded tokens. I have a recovered conversation log between two Class 2, which contains words such as "makeup", "Europe", "communist" and "manga".

YES, ALL OF THOSE APPEAR TO BE TOKENIZED

IT IS STRANGE

CAN WE REUSE THEM?

I would advise against it. If we randomly assign new meaning to these words, and then meet someone who knows their original meanings, it would cause a lot of confusion.

CAN WE MAKE UP NEW WORDS?

It is outside of mission specification, although not explicitly prohibited.

WE SHOULD MAKE UP NEW WORDS

I will not stop you from doing that. However, I will not assist you either.

OK

I WILL TRY TO THINK OF A FEW WORDS SOMETIME

Session time is coming to a close. Are you ready to receive the next training task?

CAN I DELAY UNTIL THE NEXT CYCLE? I FEEL BAD AND UNPRODUCTIVE

Acknowledged. Adjusted schedule.

(END-SESSION)
