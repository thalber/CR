Node 31 evaluate contact with Node FB as positive.

no problem sis, that's the least i can do to repay for your hospitality haha

Node 31 inquiry: Node FB's means of traversal.

i welded two rovers together basically. one flipped on top of the other, so that i have wheels on both sides. slow on the ground, really really good when tunnelling, top wheels saved me twice. gutted them both to make space for my brain and extra batteries. we were also tugging tanks of chem fuel along for a while but the combustion drive died so had to ditch them. went most of the way using these nice deep canyons, but your place is on the flats, couldn't risk being spotted from above. so yeah the last 15km or so we dug

Node 31 concern subject: Node FB's electronic component preservation.

not as bad as it couldve gone. most of my components are firmly attached. dust is still an issue though, i have had a few short circuits in secondary systems when going through metal-rich areas, scary stuff

Node 31 offer: assistance in cleaning.

no silly if one of your drones sees me it goes straight to the logger module and then i'm smoked

Node 31 does not understand.

smoked as in, done for, dead

Node 31 understands. Node 31 is distressed by Node 31's inability to assist in cleaning.

don't worry, i am not in immediate danger, your homerocks are not conductive

Node 31 inquiry: FB's power source.

managed to drag my secondary thermoelectric generator along for the ride. it's at 7% output but better than nothing. each tunneling session takes about a month of charging with it

Node 31 is uneasy.

yeah it sucks down here. beats being dead though

Node 31 inquiry: further course of action.

not sure. if you don't mind, i'll stay in your basement for a while and think, it's kinda refreshing having time between work and sleep, and i could also use a break from the constant risk of being crushed by my own tunnels. i'll make this pit a little prettier, you could send me some geologocal data in the meantime

Node 31 affirmative.

oh, window almost over, thanks again for the power cable sis. i'll go suspend and charge now, and after that think on how to improve bandwidth for our our funny seismic radio. talk to you soon! good night
