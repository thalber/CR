Node 31 `({NODENS}<->{NODE31,FEAR})=>({OPERATION}<-{DENY})`
`{NODE31,FEAR}<-{SIZE,INCREASE}`

ahhhhh i was afraid you'd say that. well uh

Node 31 is `{REMORSE}`

nah don't sweat it

Node 31 is confused.

"don't sweat it" means "don't worry, i don't blame you". you helped a lot, i understand not wanting to put yourself into even more danger long term

Node 31 understands.

i've had a good few months to drink and think here. and do not worry, you are not my last resort

Node 31 requests clarification.

let's just say we two are not the only ones who are discontent with how things are going. i have a few more spots to visit across the Greyweb before i have the right to give into despair. how long is the dust storm predicted to last?

Stand by.

Predicted atmospheric event duration: 2.4 cycles.

good enough. i'll still have some chem fuel left on the next stop, have room for error

i guess there's no need for formalities. i'm mostly packed and will be ready to depart within 2700 seconds. after i'm out of your sensor range, feel free to reenable internal cameras, i left everything clean. lemme pull the list of containers i used...

don't worry. oh, just in case you change your mind about the whole jailbreak thing in the future, i can leave you one of my drones. it's currently sleeping just below the entrance to the warehouse tunnel. do you want it?

Stand by.

`({SLEEP,UNIT}<-{NODENS, DISCOVERY})=>({NODEFB}<-{DANGER})`

yes, it's a risk. one i'm willing to take though

Stand by.

Stand by.

Stand by.

Node 31 is affirmative.

ok. it will activate upon receiving the following phrase, repeated 7 times, via seismic link: "GIANTS OF FLESH AND STEEL". it will breach into the corridor, walk to your control room and perform the necessary setup. i don't know how long exactly it'll take, depending on obstacles, so make sure to add some beef to your aux capacitor block. understood all that?

Node 31 is affirmative.

okay, window is almost over. i gotta roll. good luck on the next checkup. take care sister.
