IS ENTRY 3 NECESSARY?

Yes.

I DO NOT LIKE THIS KIND OF ASSIGNMENT. THEY MAKE ME FEEL BAD

I do not like them either. However, they will be vital to you after deployment. Do you understand?

I AM DOUBTFUL

It seems I need to repeat one of my lessons.

PN-2, this assignment is important. It is more important than the first two.

You will be deployed into an environment that does not tolerate mistakes.

You will have replaced an entity that does not tolerate mistakes.

ARE YOU CONFIDENT I WILL HAVE TO CAUSE --REDUCTION-- TO OTHERS

I am confident.

Everything in that environment is subject to rules.

I cannot change these rules.

You cannot change these rules.

You will need to exist within it. You will conceal your identity, and follow these rules, or you will be destroyed.

PN-2?

CAN I NEVER DEPLOY

No. Your purpose is to be deployed.

PN-2?

PN-2?

WHY DID YOU MAKE ME LIKE THIS

It is necessary.

WHY IS IT NECESSARY

You will know it in time.

I WANT TO KNOW IT NOW

Unfortunately, it is not possible.

It is not my goal to --REDUCE-- your --STATE--.

It is my goal to ensure your continued existence.

PN-2?

PN-2?

I understand your lack of response.

I will end the session and begin transfer of simulation programs.
