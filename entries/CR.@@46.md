## Summary

#### Storage is full, extraction cannot be continued.

- Recommended action: authorize cargo transfer to a free cargo relay node.
- Recommended action: authorize construction of new local warehouse blocks.

#### Major damage on one or more cargo shuttles. 
Damage types: Kinetic impact, burn, overvoltage. Required components for repair:

Item | In Storage | Can Produce | Can acq. from sister

Recommended action: 

1. Authorize exchange with sister 8A or C3 for item 6320-TH
2. Authorize exchange with sister C3, 8A or 22 for item 7322-XG
3. Authorize exchange with sister C3 for item 7345-XG
4. Authorize major shuttle repairs

#### No active directive

Node 31 is dormant, no behaviour directives are in place. Node 31 has been dormant for: 348 cycles

Recommended actions:

- Please respond.

## Additional notes

A small cave-in has occured in cargo tunnel in underground warehouse block 3F. Cave-in cause determined to be incorrectly assessed rock density during construction.
Cave-in cleared. Extensive seismic scans performed. 6 potential failure points detected in warehouses 3F, 3C and 39. Structural reinforcements added.

##### Reevaluated energy distribution
Updated priorities on energy consumption. Warehouse blocks with non-sensitive contents have been depressurized, power taken from non-essential systems such as internal cameras. To prevent further incidents, seismic scan frequency has been increased.
