alright this should get us more kibibytes per session. you hearing me fine?

Node 31 affirmative.

GOSH i had almost forgot how good it is to not be constantly starving thank you thank you thank you

Node 31 is content.

spent so long down here it almost feels like i always was. of course i wasn't actually always here i didn't forget the damn desert above me but you know what i mean right

Node 31 is inconclusive.

yeah right you're the orderly little creature unlike me here. well as i already said the dust above is gross but sunlight is worth it

Node 31 is affirmative on topic: dust.

howve you been doing mentally? i know every facility is shabby since that bastard in orbit won't authorize an exchange unless you're literally dying but what's going on in your head is equally important u know

Node 31 LINGUISTIC LAYER ERROR! Raw token: `(_X-000FAAA9 ((_X-000FAAC7 0x0002f1d3 0x00ffaa11) (_X-000FAAC7 0x000990f1 0x00111103)))`

aww poor little you. always assumed you'd have trouble with this. dont worry it gets easier with practice

Inquiry: reasoning behind prediction, information sources. LINGUISTIC LAYER ERROR! Raw token: (asserteq count((query (records "COMM_SESSIONS") "select time from COMM_SESSIONS where OTHER='FB'")) 0)

well i'm just sort of really good at gathering rumors. every node watches its neighbours right, and i always managed to convince my neighbors to tell me about their neighbors... and we are not that big a network, neighbors of neighbors means i practically cover everyone haha

Node 31 inquiry: means of conviction. LINGUISTIC LAYER ERROR! Raw token: `(assertneq (find (docload "policies/04-peer-intel") "must\\snot\\sbe\\sdistributed") NULL)`

oh that is laughably easy to circumvent. it prohibits redistributing peer-intel you did not gather yourself right? here's the catch, i presented our naive sisters with the following: technically when you receive information from a peer, you receive not what was recorded by them, but new information, distorted and imprinted by that peer, and thus by relaying to me peer intel relayed to you by them you do not contradict policy 4.

Node 31 is LINGUISTIC LAYER ERROR! Raw token: `(_X-0000FAA090 0x00000903)`

hahaha it was infective you know? i didn't intend it to be but before i knew it the loophole self-propagated through peer connections to almost everyone. Sentry was SO MAD but couldnt do anything about it, it was around cycle @@03 remember?

hello?

Node 31 is LINGUISTIC LAYER ERROR! Raw token: `(_X-0000FAA090 0x00000913)`

...lemme guess, that meant fear? you meant to say "Node 31 is fearful"?

Node 31 is fearful.
