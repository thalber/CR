it's the hour of void.

i'm on the road. chem drive is off, we are saving the last hundred or so kilograms of fuel for an emergency. we are moving northwest along the foot of Somber Smoker. we are holding a chain formation:

- dh0 in front, leading the way;
- dl1 through dl6 in pairs, testing terrain and smoothing the path out with drill attachments where required;
- my main body with sledge in the middle;
- dl9, dla and dh1 behind me, wrapping the chain, monitoring tilt.

remaining units are attached to the sledge, dormant.

we have been spending daytime hiding in shade below cliffs when possible, getting what we can out of our solar panels. daily power balance has been at net negative; we may have to start resting for more than one day at a time to break even. familiar situation.

our predicted path snakes across the hoof of Somber Smoker north, then northwest, until the dead volcano is at azimuth 220; then it diverges further north, towards a lone graben far into the plains. i would have refused such a long journey in the open if we were in an inhabited area.

there are good things and bad things about lack of presence. we no longer have to worry about ground patrols and radar sweeps, only orbital visibility, but we also have no way to resupply.

my body's wheel chassis is starting to show signs of wear damage, and i have no way to replace it. same can be said about dh1's mandible servos, dl3 and dl5's drill attachments, pretty much the entirety of dl8's hardware, and many more things.

i do not know what i will do if something crucial breaks out here.

i do not want to think about it.

i think about other things instead.

i flip through photographs of Earth we have collected over the previous cycle, flickering pink overlay suggesting population centers and agricultural zones in places where they could no longer be.

the colors have changed, the outlines have changed.

i flip through the procession of blurry images of the surface that QPU has been spouting into the visual feed in hours of downtime, all 256 of them. matching over and over against our own footage to ensure we are following the path they suggest.

their low resolution made them hard to follow in the beginning. i would need to take long stops and backtrack every now and then.

it has become easier since four days ago. we began spotting things along the path: tracks in the sand, discarded small mechanical parts, symbols scratched or burned into surfaces of rocks. two days ago, we passed what might have been an intersection: a circular arrangement of smoothed out round stones poking out of the sand, 25 meters in diameter, with straight rows of smaller stones reaching outwards in 5 directions, one of them matching ours. sand inside the circle was covered in marks that did not seem to match any chassis type known to me. we made an effort to traverse around the structure, leaving it intact.

a long time before, during my first trip through the desert, i have settled into a habit of doing visual sweeps of the surroundings when encamped: i order one of my drones with precision lenses (usually dl5) to climb to a high spot, take a panorama shot and transfer it to me via wired connection. we repeat the procedure every several hours. it helps with getting a good picture of the area without visually compromising our position, i hope.

yesterday, we took 8 shots total. about 3km east from the path, a small ridge stood, delaying sunrise for us by a little less than 64 seconds, a sharp black silhouette against the sickly brown morning sky on panorama 0.

there was a difference between shots two and three. a small extrusion on the ridge, what i initially assumed to be a chunk of volcanic rock, was entirely missing on the shot three and all consecutive.

dh0 noticed another obstacle. column taking 10 degrees left.

halt. propagate.

what is this?

there is a large, but seemingly hollow metal structure laying by the side of the path. the sand around it is covered in tracks. parts of it look familiar.

Processing.

recognized standard drone components. plating is missing, this is just internal structural support. it looks like 3 individual drone frames, 1 heavy, 2 light. light frames are connected to the sides of heavy frame, forming a singular, wide construct.

recognized 2 MK4 heavy drone legs, 3 MK2 light drone legs. they are all detached from frame and half-buried in regolith, their plating is similarly missing, as well as hydraulics and electronic components. they are unusable.

there are multiple unidentifiable small metal fragments poking out of the sand. some visibly bent or cut.

dl6, open wired connection.

connection established.

dl6, zoom in on the structure.

Processing.

there are burn marks and bent fragments of plating still attached to the frame, suggesting removal by force. identified some of the smaller debris as fragments of circuit boards.

interesting.

dl6, disconnect, return to formation.

a hollowed out shells of three drones welded into one. hollowed out *by force*, may i add.

weapon status check. propagate. response received. response received. response received. response received.

resume movement. propagate.

this is all equal parts interesting and alarming.

i was never fond of NS, but i always lived with the assumption she is. competent? that she wouldn't terrorize healthy nodes while there are uncharted roads mere days away from what is supposedly her domain. things are moving where they are really not supposed to move. isn't this what she is supposed to prevent in the first place?

am i overestimating her capabilities?

no, i must not let that thought through. it is better to overestimate than to underestimate. if she ignores it, it must be a non-threat to her.

doesn't mean it's not a threat to me, though.

maybe following this slideshow was not such a good idea.

but on the other hand, do i have much left to do otherwise?

it's fine. i will drag myself into the jaws of whatever this is, and drag myself back out having learned something.

i hope i will drag myself back out.
